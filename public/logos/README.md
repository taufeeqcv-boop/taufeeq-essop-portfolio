# Venture & service logos

Place logo image files here. They are already wired in `src/lib/config.ts` for Crisis Interceptor, Al-Kimya, Precision LGS, and Glengrove. **As soon as you add the files below, they will appear on the site** (home Bento cards and Ventures page). Logos display large (e.g. 96×128px area on cards).

## Required filenames (already in config)

| Business / service | Filename to add |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Crisis Interceptor | `crisis-interceptor.png` |
| Al-Kimya Recovery  | `al-kimya.png` |
| Precision LGS      | `precision-lgs.png` ✓ (already present) |
| Glengrove          | `glengrove.png` |
| Al-Ameen Caps      | `al-ameen-caps.png` |

Use PNG or SVG. If a file is missing, the site shows the fallback icon for that venture. Once you drop in the file with the exact name above, the logo will appear automatically.
